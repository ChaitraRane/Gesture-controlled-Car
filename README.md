# Gesture-controlled-Car
Gesture-Controlled Car â€“ This project enables a car to be controlled using hand gestures detected via a webcam. Using OpenCV and CVZone for gesture recognition and PyFirmata for Arduino communication, the system interprets finger movements to drive the car forward, backward, left, or right. Perfect for touchless control and robotics applications!
